# Scientific Mode

Currently has only a limit calculator. But, will have other advanced features like integration, differentiation and so on shortly in the future.

## Limit Calculator

As x approaches a certain value, this returns the value its function f(x) approaches.

### Currently works for:

- Piecewise functions (Within limits and maybe outside too)
- Asymptotic Functions where Desmos gives undefined

### Does not work for:

- Infinity (+/-)

### TO-DO

Update the layout,
Store user settings (and f(x)'s) in local storage so they wont have to change all the time
