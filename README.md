# Scientific Mode

Currently offers these features:
- Differentiation
- Integration
- Limits

## Limit Calculator

As x approaches a certain value, this returns the value its function f(x) approaches.

### Works for:

- Piecewise functions
- Asymptotic Functions (where Desmos gives undefined)
- Infinity and 0

### Side-effects:

- If value is outside range, evaluates first expression.

## Differentiation

Returns the derivative of a function f(x) at a user provided value

## Integration

Returns the area under a function f(x) using approximations with 'n' number of trapeziums

### Works with:

- Every function (including piecewise ones)

### TO-DO

Update the layout,
Store user settings (and f(x)'s) in local storage so they wont have to change all the time
